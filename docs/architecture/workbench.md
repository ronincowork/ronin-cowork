# Workbench — construction and surface contract

This is the construction authority for Ronin Cowork Workbenches. The owner journey is
[Workbench — finding and arranging your work](../using-ronin/workbench.md); Workspace
Kit's lower-level primitives and lifecycle live in [Workspace Kit](workspace-kit.md).

A Workbench is one frame with a discovery column and two or four numbered workspaces.
It does not own feature data. It restores placement, creates independent surface
instances, and calls the placed instance's `show()` synchronously. The surface owns the
smallest reads needed to paint itself.

## Library, profile, tenant, instance

`public/js/workbench.js` owns the shared library and frame.

- A **library definition** gives one stable type a header kind, discovery reading, and
  `create(context)` factory.
- A **profile** lists the library types one destination may place.
- A **tenant** supplies scope such as a Desk, Teams collection, or Team. It filters and
  parameterizes definitions; it does not create another Workbench implementation.
- An **instance** belongs to one workspace and optional resource key. The same type in
  two workspaces creates two rendered instances; data authorities may still be shared.
- `place(type, workspace, detail)` is the only placement path used by clicks, drag/drop,
  restoration, and programmatic openings.

The definition's `create()` draws the stable shell. Its returned `show()` or `enter()`
starts only that surface's reads. `leave()` parks active work and `destroy()` releases
surface-lifetime resources. See [the common lifecycle](workspace-kit.md#lifecycle-contract).

## Paint and data rule

A Workbench entry restores its shape and seats before network reads complete. A surface
paints saved or already-known values immediately when possible, then enriches choices or
status as its own reads return.

1. A destination must not await a catalog needed only by an unopened surface.
2. Discovery summaries may read a light index because the discovery column displays
   them. They must not use a detail, repository-analysis, or launch-assembly route.
3. A placed surface asks only for the data it displays or edits. It does not reuse a
   larger endpoint merely because that endpoint contains the required field.
4. Shared loaders may cache and deduplicate the same catalog. Caching may not broaden
   the request or turn it into a page-wide readiness gate.
5. Failure belongs to the requesting surface. One slow or failed read must not keep
   another workspace blank.
6. Async enrichment must not discard edits made after the first paint. Generation or
   ownership checks prevent stale responses from repainting replaced surfaces.

Campaign Defaults is the reference case. Its saved values are already in
`campaign.config.defaults`, so it paints them immediately. Model choices come from the
provider catalog and selectable Behaviors come from `/api/campaign-default-options`.
It does not call `/api/launch-seed`: that endpoint assembles a prospective Agent from a
Desk, Team, Workspace Folders, Agent defaults, Installations, and Behaviors, most of which
the Defaults surface neither displays nor edits.

## Entry, refresh, and intentional launch

Every destination resolves entry state in this precedence order:

1. a one-shot structured launch;
2. this browser tab's remembered Workbench state;
3. the destination's first-open defaults.

`public/js/workspace.js` owns this contract through `workbenchEntry()` and
`openWorkbenchTab()`.

- **First open:** use the destination's default shape, selected workspace, and seats only
  when there is no launch instruction and no remembered state.
- **Refresh or return:** restore the latest remembered arrangement, selected workspace,
  seat map, and destination-specific presentation preferences.
- **Structured launch:** the caller names the destination, optional route parameter,
  `replace` or `overlay`, and requested Workbench state. The instruction travels in the
  destination URL, is validated and consumed once, then removed before ordinary state is
  saved. Refresh therefore cannot replay it.
- **Replace:** replace the complete seat map while retaining unrelated destination
  preferences.
- **Overlay:** change only the named seats and fields.

Destinations validate every requested type against their profile. Missing, malformed,
mismatched, or unavailable instructions fall through to remembered state and then the
first-open floor. Feature code must not copy another tab's storage, temporarily mutate a
source view, or add link-specific restoration branches.

| Destination | First open | Notable structured opening |
|---|---|---|
| Ronin Settings | Defaults in workspace 1; Workspace Folders in workspace 2 | **Desk defaults** replaces the seats with Defaults and Launch your own |
| New Project | New Agent in workspace 1 | Links may replace or overlay New Agent/New Team and carry prompt or template detail |
| Ronin Setup | Garden in workspace 1; active journey surface in workspace 2 | Journey actions select a Setup surface without another restoration path |
| Cowork / Team | Restored seats, otherwise its empty/member seating rules | Team Configuration, documents, commons tabs, and New Agent may be addressed in seat detail |

## Surface inventory and required data

This records the implemented boundary. Update it in the same change that adds a surface,
changes its dependency, or changes a Workbench profile.

### Ronin Settings (`campaign` profile)

Entry reads the Desk record because it is the tenant and uses the light Workspace Folder
index for the discovery count. Nothing waits on either read before seats paint. The former
page-wide progressive gate is deleted.

| Surface | Required data and owner |
|---|---|
| Desk | selected Desk record already held by the tenant |
| Desk profile | selected Desk record; skin catalog enriches choices after paint |
| Defaults | `campaign.config.defaults` immediately; provider catalog and Campaign-default options afterward |
| Workspace Folders | its own root-detail read; repository facts belong here, not in its discovery summary |
| Installations | installation catalog and installed facts; Desk values come from the tenant |
| Model providers | provider runtime/catalog owned by `provider-surface.js` |
| Machine | the selected cowork-commons tab owns its read; unopened tabs do no work |
| Register / Launch your own | registration or embedded launch-form reads owned by that shared Setup surface |
| Mika / terminal | readiness and terminal transport only when placed or deliberately prewarmed |
| Document / Feedback / Password | each shared surface owns its operation |

### New Project (`launch` profile)

Entry performs no form catalog read. It restores and places the requested form first.

| Surface | Required data and owner |
|---|---|
| New Agent | Agent templates, Team roster index, Workspace Folder details, and selected Team/Desk launch seed |
| New Team | Team templates, Workspace Folder index, and Desk launch seed; live sessions only for the final name-collision gate |
| Help | local reading and currently seated form context |
| Document / Feedback | the shared surface's own read or submission |

### Ronin Setup (`setup` profile)

The Garden and selected journey surface seat immediately. Garden content, setup runtime,
and small registration/GitHub completion facts hydrate the journey and discovery column
independently.

| Surface | Required data and owner |
|---|---|
| Garden | static garden catalog; selected scene only |
| Register | registration and user-introduction records |
| Model providers | provider runtime/catalog owned by the shared provider surface |
| Workspace Folders | Workspace Folder details and GitHub connection state |
| Installations | Desk record, installation catalog, and installed facts |
| Password | authentication state owned by the shared Password surface |
| Bounty Program | registration/GitHub facts and the explicit preference it writes |
| Launch your own | no launch data until Agent, Team, or Preset is selected; that embedded form then owns its reads |
| Presets | preset catalog plus provider/root choices required by the selected preset |

### Cowork and Team (`cowork` and `team` profiles)

Sessions and Team records are legitimate entry data because they are the discovery cards
and seats. Optional feature status is independent and must not hold the frame.

| Surface | Required data and owner |
|---|---|
| Team roster / Team profile | Team records and live session-derived membership |
| Agent terminal | selected session plus terminal transport; other sessions are not mounted for it |
| Commons | only the selected tab enters: Roster, Docs, Wipeboard, Task Manager, Configuration, or another registered room |
| Team Kanban | installed capability fact, then selected Team's derived Project view |
| Cron jobs | scheduled messages for the addressed Team or collection scope |
| New Agent / New Team | canonical launch form and its dependencies listed above |
| Archived sessions | archive manifests when shown |
| Presets / Document / Feedback | the shared surface's own reads |

## Change checklist

When adding or changing a Workbench surface:

1. Register one stable type and include it only in profiles that may expose it.
2. Record its tenant input, discovery-summary input, first-paint input, and async
   enrichment input above.
3. Keep requests in the returned surface lifecycle unless data visibly belongs to the
   discovery column or defines the tenant/seats.
4. Define first-open placement separately from structured launches.
5. Verify refresh restores remembered state and does not replay a launch.
6. Verify a slow surface does not delay another surface or the frame.
7. Remove the superseded loader, route branch, cache, and test; never retain two entry or
   readiness mechanisms.

The visible-surface index in [`public/js/README.md`](../../public/js/README.md) maps each
surface to routes, state authority, and focused checks.
